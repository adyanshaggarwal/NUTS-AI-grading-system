Alice Johnson,1001,"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a by-product. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy to drive this reaction.","The key factors are light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. Light and CO2 increase the rate until limited by another factor. Temperature affects enzyme activity, with an optimum range.","Stomata allow CO2 to enter and O2 to exit, regulated by guard cells. However, they also cause water loss, forcing plants to balance gas exchange and water conservation.",cut 1 mark from total 
Bob Smith,1002,"Photosynthesis converts sunlight into glucose using CO2 and water, with oxygen as a by-product. Chlorophyll is essential for capturing light.","Light, CO2, and temperature influence photosynthesis. More light or CO2 speeds it up until another factor limits it. Temperature must be optimal for enzymes.","Stomata, controlled by guard cells, let gases in and out but also lead to water loss.",
Charlie Brown,1003,"Plants make food (glucose) from CO2 and water using sunlight, and oxygen is released.","Light, CO2, and temperature affect photosynthesis. Too hot or too cold slows it down.",Stomata help plants breathe but lose water.,
Diana Lee,1004,"Photosynthesis is how plants make glucose from CO2 and water using sunlight, and oxygen comes out.","Light, CO2, and temperature matter. Light helps, but only up to a point.",Stomata open for gases but lose water too.,
Ethan Davis,1005,Photosynthesis uses sunlight to turn CO2 and water into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll helps.,"Light, CO2, and temperature are important.",Stomata let CO2 in and O2 out but lose water.,
Fiona Green,1006,"Photosynthesis is when plants use light to make glucose from CO2 and water, releasing oxygen.","Light, CO2, and temperature change how fast it happens.",Stomata open and close for gases but cause water loss.,
George Wilson,1007,"Plants use photosynthesis to make food (glucose) from CO2 and water, with oxygen as waste.","Light, CO2, and heat affect it.",Stomata help plants breathe but lose water.,
Hannah Clark,1008,Photosynthesis is the process of making glucose from CO2 and water using sunlight. Oxygen is made too.,"Light, CO2, and temperature are factors.",Stomata let gases in and out but lose water.,
Ian Taylor,1009,"Photosynthesis turns CO2 and water into glucose using sunlight, and oxygen is released.","Light, CO2, and temperature can speed it up or slow it down.",Stomata open for CO2 but lose water.,Give remarks for ambiguous answers incase there exist any.
Julia Evans,1010,"Photosynthesis makes glucose from CO2 and water with sunlight, and oxygen is a by-product.","Light, CO2, and temperature are limiting factors.",Stomata regulate gas exchange but cause water loss.,
Kevin Adams,1011,"Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, CO2, and water. Oxygen is released.","Light and CO2 help, but temperature matters too.",Stomata let CO2 in but lose water.,
Lily White,1012,Photosynthesis uses light to make glucose from CO2 and water. Oxygen comes out.,"Light, CO2, and temperature affect the rate.",Stomata help with gas exchange but lose water.,
Mike Brown,1013,Plants do photosynthesis to make glucose from CO2 and water using light.,"Light, CO2, and temperature are important.",Stomata open for gases but lose water.,
Nina Patel,1014,Photosynthesis is when plants make glucose from CO2 and water with sunlight.,"Light, CO2, and temperature influence it.",Stomata let gases in and out.,
Oscar King,1015,Photosynthesis makes glucose from CO2 and water using light. Oxygen is made.,Light and CO2 affect it.,Stomata help plants breathe.,
Paul Scott,1016,Photosynthesis is plants making food from CO2 and water using sunlight.,Light and CO2 matter.,Stomata lose water.,
Quinn Reed,1017,Photosynthesis uses sunlight to make glucose.,Light and CO2 are factors.,Stomata open and close.,
